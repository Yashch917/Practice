# Used when we don’t know how many times to repeat, but we stop when a condition becomes False.
# Syntax----> while condition:
                 # block of code
                
# start
# condition
# increment/decrement

i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i,"Welcome To SwaRoop Wardhini")
    i+=1    # i++ not applicable only use i+=1 or i=i+1

print(i) # last value of i is 11 because--> Tenth iteration → i = 10 → prints → i becomes 11
